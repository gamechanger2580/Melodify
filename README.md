# üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
PostgreSQL Setup <br>
Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed locally and running. <br>

Create a database called musicApp.  <br>

In the database.py file, update the connection string with your PostgreSQL credentials: <br>

- DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/musicApp'
- Replace <username> and <password> with your PostgreSQL credentials.

Cloudinary Setup <br>
Create an account on Cloudinary. <br>

Get your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret from the Cloudinary Dashboard. <br>

You can configure your Cloudinary credentials in the song.py file like this: <br>

import cloudinary <br>
cloudinary.config( <br>
  cloud_name = "<your-cloud-name>", <br>
  api_key = "<your-api-key>", <br>
  api_secret = "<your-api-secret>"<br>
)<br>
Alternatively, you can store these values in a .env file: <br>

Create a .env file in the root of your project: <br>
CLOUD_NAME=<your-cloud-name> <br>
API_KEY=<your-api-key><br>
API_SECRET=<your-api-secret><br>

Update your song.py to load these values using the dotenv package:<br>
from dotenv import load_dotenv <br>
import os <br>
load_dotenv() <br>

cloudinary.config( <br>
  cloud_name = os.getenv("CLOUD_NAME"), <br>
  api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY"), 
  api_secret = os.getenv("API_SECRET")<br>
)<br>
